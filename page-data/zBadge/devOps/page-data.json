It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ECS (Elastic Container Service)</td>\n<td>AWS ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ElastiCache</td>\n<td>AWS ElastiCache offers fully managed Redis and Memcached. Seamlessly deploy, run, and scale popular open source compatible in-memory data stores.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fargate</td>\n<td>AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RDS (Relational Database Service)</td>\n<td>AWS RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>S3 (Simple Storage Service)</td>\n<td>AWS S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</td>\n<td>AWS VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WAF (Web Application Firewall)</td>\n<td>AWS WAF helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web security rules.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>The aim of these frameworks are to</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Help people understand how to progress in their work</li>\n<li>Help us evaluate and pay people fairly and consistently</li>\n<li>Help people understand the skills and behaviours we value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The framework is a compass, not a GPS.</p>\n<p>It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>The framework covers all the things we‚Äôre looking for from engineers at Assetz. We‚Äôre interested in these five elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise - Your Assetz knowledge and technical capability</li>\n<li>Impact - The size, scope and value of what you deliver</li>\n<li>Influence - How you change the world around you for the better</li>\n<li>Comms &#x26; Feedback - How you interact with others</li>\n<li>Leadership - How people around you become better and more impactful</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We sort them into four levels, and we try to give specific examples of behaviours we expect for each. Each of those levels has a fairly wide salary range associated with it, and within each level you can progress in sub-levels, labelled A‚ÄìD. So even if you‚Äôre at level 3 for a couple of years, you‚Äôll still be able to see that you‚Äôre moving forward. Basically, the more behaviours you show from your level, the more you‚Äôll progress.</p>\n<p>Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You‚Äôll agree what level of progression you‚Äôre going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you‚Äôre doing relative to that at all times.</p>\n<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Assetz as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in Assetz‚Äôs engineering team.</li>\n<li>The framework represents a career‚Äôs worth of progression, people shouldn‚Äôt expect to fly up it in 18 months!</li>\n<li>Engineering progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>\n<li>This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.</li>\n<li>You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of your questions, please ask your manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give us your feedback!</h3>\n<p>This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback.</p>\n<p>We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/zBadge/devOps","title":"‚ôæÔ∏è DevOps Engineering
