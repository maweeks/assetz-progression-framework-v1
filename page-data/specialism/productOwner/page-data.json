It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>The framework covers all the things we’re looking for from product owners at Assetz. We’re interested in these seven elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem solving - Finding solutions to difficult and complex issues</li>\n<li>User-centricity - Being user focused and putting them first</li>\n<li>Data skills - Analysing data and making informed decisions</li>\n<li>Domain knowledge - Having a deep understanding of your specialised area</li>\n<li>Execution - Ability to deliver value</li>\n<li>Works through others - Assess what needs to be done and delegate appropriately</li>\n<li>Communication &#x26; Feedback - How you interact with others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We sort them into four levels, and we try to give specific examples of behaviours we expect for each. Each of those levels has a fairly wide salary range associated with it, and within each level you can progress in sub-levels, labelled A–D. So even if you’re at level 3 for a couple of years, you’ll still be able to see that you’re moving forward. Basically, the more behaviours you show from your level, the more you’ll progress.</p>\n<p>Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You’ll agree what level of progression you’re going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you’re doing relative to that at all times.</p>\n<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Assetz as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in Assetz’s engineering team.</li>\n<li>The framework represents a career’s worth of progression, people shouldn’t expect to fly up it in 18 months!</li>\n<li>Engineering progression isn’t an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>\n<li>This isn’t a checklist – it’s possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.</li>\n<li>You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of your questions, please ask your manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give us your feedback!</h3>\n<p>This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback.</p>\n<p>We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/specialism/productOwner","title":"🚀 Product Owner Framework","sidebarTitle":"🚀 Product Owner","sidebarGroup":"Engineering Specialism","yaml":true,"levels":4,"homepage":true,"topics":[{"name":"problem solving","title":"🧠 Problem solving","content":[{"level":1,"criteria":["Assesses if features they are involved with are needed, how it solves customer problems and how it contributes to a measurable business objective.","Demonstrates enthusiasm to learn a range of problem-solving techniques and practices.","Understands how product works in their team, which problems it solves and how it is performing."],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":2,"criteria":["Works with the team to set clear goals for their remit.","Identifies assumptions and risks, and tackles them upfront, testing and learning in increments.","Uses or fosters creativity and experimentation to find and solve problems.","Considers which features to remove, as well as maintain.","Learns from failure and success.
