It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>The framework covers all the things we‚Äôre looking for from engineers at Assetz. We‚Äôre interested in these five elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise - Your Assetz knowledge and technical capability</li>\n<li>Impact - The size, scope and value of what you deliver</li>\n<li>Influence - How you change the world around you for the better</li>\n<li>Comms &#x26; Feedback - How you interact with others</li>\n<li>Leadership - How people around you become better and more impactful</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We sort them into six levels, and we try to give specific examples of behaviours we expect for each. Each of those levels has a fairly wide salary range associated with it, and within each level you can progress in sub-levels, labelled A‚ÄìD. So even if you‚Äôre at level 3 for a couple of years, you‚Äôll still be able to see that you‚Äôre moving forward. Basically, the more behaviours you show from your level, the more you‚Äôll progress.</p>\n<p>Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You‚Äôll agree what level of progression you‚Äôre going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you‚Äôre doing relative to that at all times.</p>\n<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to Assetz as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in Assetz‚Äôs engineering team.</li>\n<li>The framework represents a career‚Äôs worth of progression, people shouldn‚Äôt expect to fly up it in 18 months!</li>\n<li>Engineering progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.</li>\n<li>This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.</li>\n<li>You can find some more information in these links. If that doesn't answer most of your questions, please ask your manager.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give us your feedback!</h3>\n<p>This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback.</p>\n<p>We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/specialism/platformEngineer","title":"üõ†Ô∏è Platform Engineer Framework","sidebarTitle":"üõ†Ô∏è Platform Engineer","sidebarGroup":"Engineering Specialism","yaml":true,"levels":6,"homepage":true,"topics":[{"name":"communication","title":"üí¨ Communication","content":[{"level":1,"criteria":["Points out syntactical improvements in code reviews","Writes PR descriptions that provide basic context for the change"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":2,"criteria":null,"exampleCriteria":[{"criteria":"Provides helpful and actionable feedback in code reviews in an empathetic manner","examples":["Take a look at the levelling up your code reviews talk for some ideas"]},{"criteria":"Writes PR descriptions that provide context and provide rationale for significant decisions","examples":["I decided to X instead of Y here, I also considered Z but for these reasons I went with X"]}]},{"level":4,"criteria":["Helps people in non-technical roles understand technical constraints / trade-offs","Shares technical context and direction for less experienced engineers"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":5,"criteria":["Talks to non-technical stakeholders on appropriate level of abstraction"],"exampleCriteria":null}]},{"name":"impact","title":"üí• Impact","content":[{"level":1,"criteria":["Able to take PR feedback to improve their work"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":3,"criteria":["Contributes to writing technical design proposals (Co-authors with more experienced Engineer)","Breaks down large changes across multiple smaller PRs where appropriate"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":4,"criteria":["Leads writing small/medium scope technical designs","Makes pragmatic choices about taking on tech debt"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":5,"criteria":["Leading large scale technical infrastructure projects"],"exampleCriteria":null}]},{"name":"expertise","title":"üõ†Ô∏è Expertise","content":[{"level":1,"criteria":["Learns to write correct Node.js code, following guidance and training materials","Learns to write basic SQL queries and understands the structure of the database","Fixes simple bugs"],"exampleCriteria":[{"criteria":"Uses git to manage the development workflow effectively","examples":["Checkout, Push, Pull, Branch, Diff, Merge, Stash, Rebase, etc."]}]},{"level":2,"criteria":["Designs simple database tables","Implements asynchronous messaging between services","Deploys services to staging and production","Deploys database changes to staging and production","Fixes bugs involving a number of services and can investigate production issues","Uses appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve problems","Writes automated unit and acceptance tests","Writes correct Node.js code following accepted best practices","Writes TypeScript types to statically type-check the code at compile-time","Able to write complex SQL statements following accepted best practices","Can explain at a high level what each department does at Assetz and what business processes they support"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":3,"criteria":["Uses appropriate design patterns","Designs new schemas comprising multiple tables","Co-ordinates complex deployments and database migrations","Implements distributed systems consisting of multiple interacting services","Produces technical designs that include a consideration of scalability","Debugs production issues","Considers metrics when building a new system","Writes highly readable Node.js code","Writes efficient and performant SQL queries to solve complex problems","Champions some technologies/components, and produces technical documentation to facilitate the learning of colleagues","Understands the full lifecycle-of-a-loan process"],"exampleCriteria":[{"criteria":"Mitigates race conditions and partial failure states in distributed systems","examples":["Uses locking where appropriate, writes code that is ‚Äúself-healing‚Äù when dealing with distributed failure (e.g. data needs to be written in two or more services)"]},{"criteria":"Proactively considers security implications of their work","examples":["Appropriately ties down internal access to resources they're working with (e.g. RPC blacklisting, BigQuery permissions)","Evaluates security risks when contributing to proposals","Highlights potential security issues when raising and reviewing pull requests -
